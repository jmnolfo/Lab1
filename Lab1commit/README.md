1. What is a bit? What is a byte?
	A bit (short for binary diget) is a unit of data in a computer. A byte is eight times larger than a bit.

2. What if 8 bits were used to store a positive integer. What is the biggest/smallest possible integer?
	-128 to 127

3. How many bytes are used to store a Java integer? How is an integer like 25 stored? 
	It depends on how long the number is. An integer like 25 would only use one byte for storage becuase it is between -128 and 127
