Data Types and Java
112 Worksheet
A review of bits, bytes, and an introduction to types in Java

1. What is a bit? What is a byte?

2. What if 8 bits were used to store a positive integer. What is the biggest/smallest possible integer?

3. How many bytes are used to store a Java integer? How is an integer like 25 stored? 

4. Do some programming and testing of Java int and float.  Write a short class called “Arithmetic” that in its main method does the following 
Creates 4 local variables
Two ints (call them a and b) 
Two floats (call them x and y)  
Performs the following arithmetic operations on every combination of these two of these and outputs each of the results
Addition
Division (in both directions)

EXTRA: If you have time see what happens when you first assign the results `to either a float or an int before printing it out.

5. Java does not report integer overflow,  therefore if you make too big of a number then it loops around and becomes negative.

Write a small class called “BiggestShort” that computes in its main method the largest short value.

6. When you are all done, commit your updated repository to git

git add *
git commit -m "My Commit"
git push origin master
